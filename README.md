## üåü Overview

> *"True intelligence lies not in what we see, but in what we understand; not in remembering moments, but in grasping eternity."*

Between seeing and understanding lies a profound abyss of cognition. Do multimodal large models truly **think** with videos, or are they merely performing visual theatrics?

When humans watch videos, we don't just "see" ‚Äì we **think**. We understand the passage of time, capture the coherence of actions, and perceive the essence of things. However, existing video benchmarks often resemble image benchmarks, with questions like *"What action does the person perform in the video?"* or *"What color is the woman's dress in the video?"* For such questions, models typically only need to scan a few key frames to answer, without requiring deep temporal, spatial, and interactive reasoning.

We present **GLIMPSE**, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can truly **"think with videos"**. Unlike previous benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video understanding that goes beyond static image cues. It contains **3,269 videos** and over **4,342 highly vision-centric questions**, covering **11 categories** including trajectory analysis, temporal reasoning, and forensic detection.

üéØ **Key Features:**

- **Human-Crafted Questions**: All questions are meticulously designed by human annotators, requiring viewing the complete video and reasoning over full video context ‚Äì what we call **"thinking with videos"**
- **Beyond Frame Scanning**: These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or relying solely on text
- **Rigorous Validation**: GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy in human evaluation, but current LVLMs face significant challenges
- **Challenging for SOTA**: Even the best-performing model GPT-o3 only achieves 66.43% accuracy

GLIMPSE is meticulously curated through a three-step process: video collection, question-answer annotation, and quality review. The benchmark encompasses **3,269 videos** and **4,342 high-quality visual-centric questions** across **11 comprehensive categories**:

### üìã Categories Overview

**üéØ (1) Trajectory Analysis**: Analyzing object movement patterns, directions, and displacement over time, requiring fine-grained recognition and temporal reasoning.

**‚è∞ (2) Temporal Reasoning**: Understanding timing and sequence of events, focusing on temporal order relationships rather than simple event localization.

**üìä (3) Quantitative Estimation**: Counting dynamic events such as repeated actions or object appearances/disappearances in video content.

**üé¨ (4) Event Recognition**: Determining whether events occur and their sequential relationships, especially in multi-event scenarios.

**üîÑ (5) Reverse Event Inference**: Reconstructing event flow from partial information to determine correct action sequences.

**üèûÔ∏è (6) Scene Context Awareness**: Understanding background changes throughout videos, evaluating spatial understanding and context recognition.

**‚ö° (7) Velocity Estimation**: Calculating relative speeds of moving objects by analyzing displacement over time.

**üé• (8) Cinematic Dynamics**: Identifying camera motion by analyzing foreground-background relationships and movement patterns.

**üîç (9) Forensic Authenticity Analysis**: Detecting fake videos generated by text-to-video models to assess video authenticity verification capabilities.

**ü§ñ (10) Robotics Evaluation**: Identifying and assessing robotic actions including grasping, moving, and assembling tasks.

**üë• (11) Multi-Object Interaction**: Analyzing interactions between multiple entities including physical contact, collaboration, or conflict scenarios.


All videos are controlled to be **20 seconds to 2 minutes** in length to maintain optimal complexity and reference value.

### ‚úÖ Quality Assurance

- **Manual Annotation**: All questions crafted by English-proficient researchers
- **Full Video Requirement**: Each question requires understanding the entire video, not just single frames
- **Bidirectional Testing**: Yes/no questions include reverse pairs to reduce evaluation bias
- **Rigorous Review**: Multi-stage quality control ensures visual-centricity and answerability

### Research Significance

Our results reveal that LVLMs still struggle to move beyond surface-level reasoning and truly achieve **"thinking with videos"**. GLIMPSE provides a new standard for evaluating and advancing multimodal AI's video understanding capabilities, highlighting the gap between current model performance and genuine video comprehension.
